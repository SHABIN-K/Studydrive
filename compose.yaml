  # define the database service
  db:
    # specify the image to use for the db service from docker hub. If we have a custom image, we can specify that in this format
    # In the above two services, we're using the build context to build the image for the service from the Dockerfile so we specify the image as "build: ./frontend" or "build: ./backend".
    # but for the db service, we're using the image from docker hub so we specify the image as "image: mongo:latest"
    # you can find the image name and tag for mongodb from docker hub here: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo
    image: mongo:latest

    # specify the ports to expose for the db service
    # generally, we do this in api service using mongodb atlas. But for demo purposes, we're using a local mongodb instance
    # usually, mongodb runs on port 27017. So we're exposing the port 27017 on the host machine and mapping it to the port 27017 inside the container
    ports:
      - 27017:27017

    # specify the volumes to mount for the db service
    # we're mounting the volume named "anime" inside the container at /data/db directory
    # this is done so that the data inside the mongodb container is persisted even if the container is stopped
    volumes:
      - db-data:/data/db

# define the volumes to be used by the services
