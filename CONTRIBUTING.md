# Contributing to StudyDrive
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `MAIN`.
2. If you've added code, please test it.
3. Make sure your code works.
4. Issue that pull request! (dev branch)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
- Let prettier and eslint to take care of the formatting
- Make sure that the code is easily readable and understandable

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/SHABIN-K/studydrive/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SHABIN-K/studydrive/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SHABIN-K/studydrive/issues); it's that easy!
### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Asking for help
You can either create an issue or even reach me out directly via my personal email heyshabink@gmail.com for any assistance or clarifications.
